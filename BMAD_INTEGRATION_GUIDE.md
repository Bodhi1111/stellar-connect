## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Existing Stellar Connect requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Ollama with mistral:7b model
- Neo4j and Qdrant databases
- CrewAI framework
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Deploy BMAD modules**:
```bash
# Files are already in your project root
bmad_orchestration.py
bmad_config.yaml
bmad_integration.py
```

2. **Import BMAD orchestrator**:
```python
from bmad_orchestration import BMADOrchestrator
from bmad_integration import BMADDashboardAdapter
```

3. **Initialize in your application**:
```python
# Create orchestrator instance
orchestrator = BMADOrchestrator()

# Create dashboard adapter for Streamlit
adapter = BMADDashboardAdapter()
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Requirement Analysis Workflow

```python
from bmad_orchestration import BMADOrchestrator

orchestrator = BMADOrchestrator()

# Analyze requirements for improving conversion
request = """
We need to improve our estate planning sales conversion rate.
Analyze current patterns and suggest system enhancements.
"""

result = orchestrator.execute_workflow("requirements", request)
print(result)
```

### Example 2: BMAD-Enhanced Query Processing

```python
from bmad_integration import BMADDashboardAdapter

adapter = BMADDashboardAdapter()

# Process query with full BMAD enhancement
query = "What are the top objections in estate planning sales?"
result = adapter.process_chat_query(query, mode="bmad_enhanced")

# Process with sales focus only
result = adapter.process_chat_query(query, mode="sales_focused")

# Process with technical focus
result = adapter.process_chat_query(query, mode="technical")
```

### Example 3: Sales Deal Analysis

```python
from bmad_integration import AdvancedBMADWorkflows

workflows = AdvancedBMADWorkflows()

deal_info = "High-value estate planning deal with multiple beneficiaries"
analysis = workflows.sales_deal_analysis(deal_info)

print(analysis["business_analysis"])
print(analysis["sales_strategy"])
print(analysis["technical_requirements"])
```

## Workflow Definitions

### Requirement Analysis Workflow
```yaml
Steps:
1. Business Analyst: Extract requirements
2. Sales Specialist: Validate sales impact
3. Project Manager: Create project plan
```

### System Implementation Workflow
```yaml
Steps:
1. Solution Architect: Design architecture
2. Developer: Implement solution
3. QA Tester: Test implementation
4. Project Manager: Validate delivery
```

### Sales Optimization Workflow
```yaml
Steps:
1. Sales Specialist: Analyze performance
2. Business Analyst: Define improvements
3. Solution Architect: Design enhancements
4. Developer: Implement enhancements
```

### Continuous Improvement Workflow
```yaml
Steps:
1. QA Tester: System health check
2. Sales Specialist: Analyze metrics
3. Business Analyst: Identify opportunities
4. Project Manager: Prioritize backlog
```

## Integration with Streamlit Dashboard

### Adding BMAD Mode Selector

```python
# In copilot_dashboard.py, add mode selector
mode = st.selectbox(
    "Processing Mode",
    ["standard", "bmad_enhanced", "sales_focused", "technical"]
)

# Process query with selected mode
from bmad_integration import BMADDashboardAdapter
adapter = BMADDashboardAdapter()
response = adapter.process_chat_query(user_query, mode=mode)
```

### Display Agent Metrics

```python
# Get and display BMAD metrics
metrics = adapter.get_agent_metrics()

st.metric("BMAD Agents", metrics["bmad_agents"]["total"])
st.metric("Active Workflows", len(metrics["workflows_available"]))
```

## Configuration Customization

### Modifying Agent Behaviors

Edit `bmad_config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
agents:
  business_analyst:
    capabilities:
      - your_custom_capability
    memory:
      retention_days: 120  # Increase retention
```

### Adding New Workflows

```yaml
workflows:
  custom_workflow:
    name: "Custom Analysis"
    steps:
      - agent: "business_analyst"
        action: "custom_analysis"
      - agent: "developer"
        action: "implement_solution"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Agent Parallelization

```python
# Run multiple BMAD agents in parallel
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def parallel_analysis(queries):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
        futures = []
        for query in queries:
            future = executor.submit(
                adapter.process_chat_query,
                query,
                "bmad_enhanced"
            )
            futures.append(future)

        results = [f.result() for f in futures]
    return results
```

### Caching Strategies

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_bmad_query(query: str, mode: str) -> str:
    return adapter.process_chat_query(query, mode)
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

```python
# Set verbose=True in agent creation
config.verbose = True
```

### Track Agent Performance

```python
# Get agent status
status = orchestrator.get_agent_status()
print(f"Active agents: {status['agents']}")
print(f"Handoff history: {status['handoff_history']}")
```

### Debug Workflow Execution

```python
# Enable debug mode
orchestrator.execute_workflow("requirements", request)
# Check terminal output for detailed agent interactions
```

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Selection**: Choose appropriate agents for your use case
   - Use Business Analyst for requirement gathering
   - Use Sales Specialist for domain-specific insights
   - Use QA Tester for validation and testing

2. **Workflow Design**: Create focused, single-purpose workflows
   - Keep workflows under 5 steps
   - Ensure clear handoffs between agents
   - Define explicit acceptance criteria

3. **Performance**: Optimize for your environment
   - Use caching for repeated queries
   - Parallelize independent agent tasks
   - Monitor resource usage

4. **Integration**: Maintain compatibility
   - Test BMAD agents with existing CrewAI agents
   - Validate tool compatibility
   - Document custom modifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent timeout**: Increase `max_iter` in agent config
2. **Memory issues**: Reduce `retention_days` in memory config
3. **Tool conflicts**: Check tool compatibility in `bmad_config.yaml`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test BMAD orchestration
python3 bmad_orchestration.py

# Test integration
python3 bmad_integration.py

# Check agent status
python3 -c "from bmad_orchestration import BMADOrchestrator; o = BMADOrchestrator(); print(o.get_agent_status())"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Learning**: Implement reinforcement learning for agent improvement
2. **Custom Tools**: Add specialized tools for each BMAD agent
3. **Distributed Execution**: Deploy agents across multiple nodes
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Enable synchronous agent communication
5. **Visual Workflow Builder**: Create GUI for workflow design

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check existing agent logs in terminal output
2. Review `bmad_config.yaml` for configuration issues
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed and running
4. Verify Ollama and database connections
