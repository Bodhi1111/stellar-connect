## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents for complex sales intelligence workflows. The system uses CrewAI framework for agent communication and task delegation.

**Agent Orchestration Pattern:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- Multi-agent coordination via CrewAI framework
- Sequential task processing with context passing
- Specialized agents for different aspects of sales intelligence
- Task delegation based on agent expertise and capabilities

**Agent Communication Flow:**
[Source: architecture.md#Core Workflows - Query Processing]
1. User Query → Stellar Crew → Task Creation
2. Retrieval Agent → Database Queries → Context Collection
3. Data Extraction/Content Agent → LLM Processing → Final Output

### Agent Definitions and Specializations

**Knowledge Retrieval Specialist:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- **Role:** Hybrid knowledge system expert
- **Tools:** vector_tool, kg_tool for database access
- **Responsibility:** Retrieve comprehensive context from dual-memory system
- **Expertise:** Strategic use of semantic vs. graph search

**Data Analyst:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- **Role:** Structured data transformation specialist
- **Tools:** extraction_tool for Pydantic validation
- **Responsibility:** Transform conversations into structured JSON data
- **Expertise:** Sales metrics, outcomes, and detail extraction

**Communications Expert:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- **Role:** Professional content generation specialist
- **Tools:** No direct database tools (works from context)
- **Responsibility:** Draft polished, human-readable content
- **Expertise:** Professional tone, sales communication patterns

### Task Creation Workflows

**General Q&A Tasks:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#CrewAI Agent System]
1. **Retrieve Task:** Strategic database queries for comprehensive context
2. **Generate Task:** Professional answer generation from retrieved context

**Structured Record Tasks:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#CrewAI Agent System]
1. **Retrieve Task:** Meeting-specific context with sales focus
2. **Extract Task:** Structured JSON generation using Pydantic validation

**Email Recap Tasks:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#CrewAI Agent System]
1. **Retrieve Task:** Meeting context focusing on discussion points and action items
2. **Generate Task:** Professional email draft with appropriate tone and structure

### CrewAI Framework Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Agent Framework]
- **Framework:** CrewAI 0.1.x for multi-agent coordination
- **Processing Mode:** Process.sequential for ordered task execution
- **Logging Level:** verbose=2 for comprehensive agent thought processes
- **Context Passing:** Task dependencies with context parameter

### Agent Communication Patterns
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- **Task Dependencies:** context=[previous_task] for information flow
- **Expected Outputs:** Clear output specifications for each task
- **Agent Selection:** Automatic based on role and tool requirements
- **Result Aggregation:** Final output collection from task chain

### LLM Configuration and Consistency
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Configuration Management]
- **Global LLM:** Settings.llm configured in init_settings()
- **Model:** llama3:8b-instruct with 120-second timeout
- **Consistency:** All agents use same model configuration
- **Performance:** Optimized for local inference via Ollama

### Error Handling and Recovery
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]
- **Agent Failures:** Isolated error handling without crew termination
- **Task Retries:** Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- **Timeout Handling:** 120-second LLM timeout with graceful fallback
- **Logging:** Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Performance Monitoring
- **Execution Timing:** Task-level performance tracking
- **Agent Metrics:** Individual agent performance monitoring
- **Context Size:** Monitoring context length and processing efficiency
- **Success Rates:** Task completion and failure rate tracking

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Intelligence Layer]
- **Agent Tools:** Uses vector_tool, kg_tool, extraction_tool
- **Streamlit UI:** Receives crew execution results
- **Configuration:** Global settings from src/config.py
- **Models:** Ollama service for LLM inference

### Testing Strategy
Unit tests should cover:
- Agent instantiation and configuration
- Task creation with proper parameters
- Context passing between sequential tasks
- Error handling for agent failures
- Crew execution with mock agents

Integration tests should verify:
- End-to-end workflow execution with real databases
- Agent communication and context preservation
- Performance under various query complexities
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
