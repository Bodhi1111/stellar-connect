- **Competitive Intelligence:** Market analysis, win/loss, positioning
- **Sales Enablement:** Content, training, methodology optimization

**Multi-Agent Architecture Evolution:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- Evolves from 3 generalist agents to 7 specialist agents
- Maintains existing agent communication patterns
- Adds domain-specific expertise and specialized tools
- Enables complex multi-agent collaboration workflows

### Specialist Agent Definitions

**Revenue Operations Agent:**
```python
revenue_ops_agent = Agent(
    role='Revenue Operations Specialist',
    goal='Optimize sales pipeline, forecasting accuracy, and revenue process efficiency.',
    backstory="You are a data-driven revenue operations expert with deep expertise in sales analytics, forecasting models, and process optimization. You excel at identifying pipeline bottlenecks, predicting revenue outcomes, and recommending process improvements.",
    tools=[pipeline_analysis_tool, forecasting_tool, process_optimization_tool],
    llm=AGENT_LLM,
    verbose=True

```

### Specialized Tool Architecture

**Pipeline Analysis Tool:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - Agent Tools]
```python
class PipelineAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Sales Pipeline Analysis"
    description: str = "Analyzes sales pipeline health, velocity, and forecasting accuracy with revenue operations focus."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Specialized pipeline analysis with deal progression tracking
        # Revenue forecasting and quota attainment analysis
        # Process bottleneck identification and optimization
        pass
```

**Performance Analysis Tool:**
```python
class PerformanceAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Sales Performance Analysis"
    description: str = "Analyzes individual rep performance, identifies coaching opportunities, and optimizes territory assignments."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Rep performance benchmarking and comparison
        # Skill gap analysis and coaching recommendations
        # Territory optimization and quota management
        pass
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Workflows

**Collaborative Analysis Pattern:**
[Source: architecture.md#Core Workflows]
1. **Query Routing:** Determine which specialist agents needed
2. **Parallel Analysis:** Multiple agents analyze from their perspectives
3. **Information Sharing:** Agents share insights and findings
4. **Consensus Building:** Resolve conflicts and synthesize insights
5. **Joint Recommendations:** Combine specialist insights into actionable intelligence

**Agent Communication Protocols:**
```python
class SalesAgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, specialist_agents):
        self.agents = specialist_agents
        self.collaboration_protocols = self._setup_protocols()

    def route_query(self, query: str) -> List[Agent]:
        # Determine which specialists should handle the query
        pass

    def coordinate_analysis(self, agents: List[Agent], context: str) -> Dict:
        # Manage multi-agent collaborative analysis
        pass
```

### Integration with Existing Framework

**Backward Compatibility Strategy:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#CrewAI Agent System]
- Existing 3-agent system remains functional for basic queries
- New specialist agents activated for complex analysis
- Existing task creation functions enhanced with specialist routing
- Streamlit interface seamlessly integrates specialist capabilities

**Enhanced Task Creation Functions:**
```python
def create_revenue_analysis_tasks(query: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> list:
    # Multi-agent revenue analysis workflow
    pass

def create_competitive_analysis_tasks(query: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> list:
    # Collaborative competitive intelligence workflow
    pass

def create_performance_analysis_tasks(query: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> list:
    # Multi-agent performance optimization workflow
    pass
```

### Performance Monitoring Architecture

**Agent Performance Metrics:**
[Source: architecture.md#Monitoring and Observability]
- **Execution Time:** Task completion time per specialist agent
- **Accuracy Score:** Quality assessment of specialist analysis
- **Collaboration Efficiency:** Multi-agent workflow effectiveness
- **Resource Utilization:** Memory and compute usage per agent
- **Success Rate:** Task completion and user satisfaction rates

**Load Balancing Strategy:**
- **Query Classification:** Route queries to appropriate specialists
- **Workload Distribution:** Balance tasks across available agents
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Adjust agent allocation based on demand
- **Performance Optimization:** Route to best-performing agents

### Testing Strategy

Unit tests should cover:
- Individual specialist agent instantiation and configuration
- Specialized tool functionality and accuracy
- Agent communication protocol correctness
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Backward compatibility with existing system

Integration tests should verify:
- Multi-agent collaboration workflows
- Specialist agent coordination and consensus building
- End-to-end specialist analysis pipelines
- Performance under various query complexities
- Integration with enhanced knowledge base from Story 5.1

Load tests should validate:
- 7-agent system performance under concurrent queries
- Resource utilization and memory management
- Agent load balancing effectiveness
- System scalability with specialist agents
