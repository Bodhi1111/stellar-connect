## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the user interface layer that provides accessible interaction with the complex AI agent system. The Streamlit interface abstracts the technical complexity while providing powerful functionality.

**UI Architecture Pattern:**
[Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]
- Chat-first interaction pattern for natural language queries
- Sidebar controls for specialized task automation
- Session state management for conversation persistence
- Real-time feedback during long-running agent operations

**Integration Strategy:**
[Source: architecture.md#Component Diagram]
- Streamlit UI → CrewAI Orchestration → Agent Tools → Databases
- Direct Python integration (no HTTP API required)
- Session state for conversation history management

### Streamlit Configuration and Layout
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#UI Framework]
- **Framework:** Streamlit for rapid AI/ML application prototyping
- **Layout:** Wide configuration for optimal space utilization
- **Styling:** Professional aesthetic focused on data density and clarity
- **Responsiveness:** Optimized for desktop browsers (Safari, Chrome)

**Application Structure:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Streamlit Interface]
```python
app.py                          # Main Streamlit application
├── Chat Interface              # Primary user interaction
├── Sidebar Controls            # Task-specific actions
├── Message History            # Conversation display
└── Session State Manager      # State persistence
```

### Chat Interface Implementation
[Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture - Component Architecture]
- **Message History:** Persistent conversation across sessions
- **Input Handling:** st.chat_input with real-time processing
- **Role Attribution:** User and assistant message differentiation
- **Conversation Threading:** Chronological message display

**Session State Schema:**
```python
{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Initial greeting"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "User query"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "AI response"}
    ]
}
```

### Specialized Task Controls
[Source: architecture.md#User Interface Design Goals]
- **Client Name Input:** Text field for task-specific processing
- **Structured Record Generation:** JSON output with pretty-printing
- **Email Recap Generation:** Markdown formatted professional emails
- **Task Validation:** Input validation before crew execution

**Task Execution Pattern:**
```python
def execute_task(task_creator, task_name, output_format="markdown"):
    # Validation → Spinner → Crew Execution → Result Formatting → UI Update
```

### CrewAI Integration Points
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Intelligence Layer]
- **General Queries:** create_general_query_tasks() for chat functionality
- **Structured Records:** create_structured_record_tasks() for JSON extraction
- **Email Generation:** create_email_recap_tasks() for professional communication
- **Crew Execution:** run_crew() for all agent orchestration

### User Experience Design
[Source: architecture.md#User Interface Design Goals]
- **Processing Feedback:** st.spinner with descriptive messages
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages with recovery guidance
- **Immediate Updates:** st.rerun() for real-time UI refresh
- **Professional Styling:** Command-center interface optimized for efficiency

**Interaction Paradigms:**
- Chat-first intelligence for natural language queries
- One-click actions for specialized tasks
- Auto-process pipeline with visual status indicators
- Inline results display without modal dialogs

### State Management Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture - State Management]
- **Session State:** Streamlit's built-in session state for conversation history
- **State Persistence:** Messages preserved across page refreshes
- **Error State:** Graceful error handling without state corruption
- **Processing State:** Spinner states for long-running operations

### Output Formatting Specifications
**JSON Output:**
```python
formatted_result = f"**{task_name} for {client_name}:**\n\n```json\n{json.dumps(json.loads(result), indent=2)}\n```"
```

**Markdown Output:**
```python
formatted_result = f"**{task_name} for {client_name}:**\n\n{result}"
```

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]
- **Crew Execution Errors:** try-catch with st.error() user feedback
- **Input Validation:** Client name requirement with st.sidebar.warning()
- **Processing Timeouts:** Graceful handling of long-running operations
- **State Recovery:** Error states don't corrupt conversation history

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture - Frontend Performance]
- **Loading Strategy:** Lazy loading with st.spinner for user feedback
- **Caching Strategy:** Streamlit @st.cache_data for static content
- **Memory Management:** Efficient session state for conversation history
- **Response Time:** Immediate UI feedback with processing indicators

### Integration Testing Requirements
- **End-to-End Workflows:** Chat queries → Agent execution → Result display
- **Task Automation:** Sidebar controls → Crew execution → Formatted output
- **Error Scenarios:** Database failures → User error messages → Recovery
- **Session Persistence:** Conversation history across page refreshes
