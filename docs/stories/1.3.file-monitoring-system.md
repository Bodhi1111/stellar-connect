# Story 1.3: Automated File Monitoring System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** sales advisor,
**I want** the system to automatically detect and process new transcript files,
**so that** I don't need to manually trigger processing for each meeting recording.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. File system monitoring service watches incoming_transcripts/ directory for new files
2. File detection triggers within 30 seconds with support for sync delays
3. Automatic processing pipeline triggered for supported file types (txt, pdf, docx)
4. Processed files automatically moved to archive/ directory with timestamp collision handling
5. Background daemon service runs continuously with automatic restart capability
6. Comprehensive logging of file events, processing status, and errors
7. Error handling for file permission issues and invalid file formats

  - [x] Handle processing errors without stopping monitoring service
  - [x] Log processing start and completion events

- [x] **Task 4: File Archiving System** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement archive_file() method for processed file management
  - [x] Create archive/ directory automatically if not present
  - [x] Handle filename collisions with timestamp suffix
  - [x] Use os.rename() for atomic file movement
  - [x] Log archiving success and failures

- [x] **Task 5: Daemon Service Implementation** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Implement start_monitoring() as main service loop
  - [x] Configure continuous monitoring with keyboard interrupt handling
  - [x] Add graceful shutdown with observer.stop() and observer.join()
  - [x] Set up service to run as background daemon
  - [x] Include restart logic for service reliability

- [x] **Task 6: Logging and Error Handling** (AC: 6, 7)
  - [x] Comprehensive logging for all file events and processing steps
  - [x] Error handling for file permission issues
  - [x] Graceful handling of invalid file formats
  - [x] Processing error isolation (continue monitoring on failures)
  - [x] Detailed error messages with context information

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the event-driven processing pattern that triggers the automated ingestion pipeline. The file monitoring system provides the entry point for the entire transcript processing workflow.

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
[Source: architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
- File system monitoring triggers automatic ingestion pipeline
- Eliminates manual intervention for transcript processing
- Maintains system responsiveness through background service

**Integration Point:**
[Source: architecture.md#Component Diagram]
- File Monitor → Ingestion Pipeline → Storage Layer
- Watchdog library for cross-platform file system monitoring
- Debouncing for file sync delays (Google Drive, etc.)

### Component Implementation Details

**File System Monitoring:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#File Monitoring]
- `watchdog` library for cross-platform file system events
- Observer pattern for non-blocking file detection
- FileSystemEventHandler for event processing

**Directory Structure:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Data Directories]
```
stellar-connect/
├── incoming_transcripts/    # Watch folder for new files
├── archive/                 # Processed files storage
```

**File Processing Flow:**
[Source: architecture.md#Core Workflows]
1. File detected in incoming_transcripts/
2. Wait 2 seconds for sync completion
3. Trigger process_new_file() from ingestion pipeline
4. Move processed file to archive/ with collision handling

### Service Configuration
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Core Application]
- **Primary Module:** `src/monitor.py`
- **Entry Point:** `start_monitoring()` function
- **Runtime Mode:** Background daemon service
- **Restart Capability:** Automatic recovery from failures

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]
- **File Permission Issues:** Graceful logging without service termination
- **Processing Failures:** Isolated error handling, continue monitoring
- **Invalid Formats:** Skip unsupported files with warning logs
- **Service Failures:** Automatic restart with observer.join()

### File Archiving Logic
- **Collision Handling:** Timestamp suffix for duplicate filenames
- **Atomic Operations:** os.rename() for reliable file movement
- **Directory Creation:** Automatic archive/ directory initialization
- **Error Recovery:** Continue monitoring even if archiving fails

### Performance Characteristics
[Source: architecture.md#Security and Performance]
- **Detection Latency:** <30 seconds from file creation
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal overhead for continuous monitoring
- **File Sync Handling:** 2-second debounce for cloud storage delays
- **Service Reliability:** Continuous operation with graceful shutdown

### Integration Dependencies
- **src/ingestion.py:** process_new_file() function for pipeline trigger
- **File System:** incoming_transcripts/ and archive/ directories
- **Configuration:** PROJECT_ROOT path resolution for relative directories

### Testing
Unit tests should cover:
- File detection and filtering logic
- Archive file collision handling
- Error handling for permission issues
- Service startup and shutdown procedures

Integration tests should verify:
- End-to-end file processing workflow
- Multiple file handling without conflicts
- Service recovery from processing failures
- Directory creation and management
