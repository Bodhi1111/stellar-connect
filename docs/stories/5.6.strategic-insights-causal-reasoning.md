- Causal reasoning to understand underlying business drivers
- Predictive intelligence for strategic planning and decision-making
- Executive-level communication of complex analytical insights

**Integration with Complete Agentic RAG:**
[Source: architecture.md#Components - CrewAI Agent System]
- Coordinates with all specialist agents for comprehensive analysis
- Leverages planning engine for strategic initiative development
- Utilizes quality assurance for validated insights
- Produces executive-ready strategic intelligence

### Estate Strategist Implementation

**Strategist Agent Definition:**
```python
estate_strategist = Agent(
    role='Strategic Business Intelligence Architect',
    goal='Synthesize multi-agent analysis into actionable strategic intelligence with causal reasoning and executive communication.',
    backstory="You are a senior strategic consultant who excels at synthesizing complex business intelligence into clear, actionable strategic insights. You understand causality, can identify leverage points, and communicate strategic intelligence to executive leadership.",
    tools=[strategic_synthesis_tool, causal_reasoning_tool, executive_communication_tool],

### Testing Strategy

Unit tests should cover:
- Strategic insight synthesis accuracy
- Causal reasoning logic and statistical validity
- Recommendation generation quality and relevance
- Business impact calculation accuracy
- Executive summary clarity and completeness

Integration tests should verify:
- End-to-end strategic intelligence generation
- Multi-agent coordination and synthesis
- Executive dashboard functionality
- Performance under complex analysis scenarios

User acceptance tests should validate:
- Executive summary usefulness for decision-making
- Recommendation actionability and clarity
- Strategic intelligence accuracy and relevance
- Dashboard usability for C-level consumption
