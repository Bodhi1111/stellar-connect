# Stellar Connect Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Reduce administrative work from 30 to 7 minutes per call through automated email generation and CRM updates
• Process 100% of daily transcripts (5-10) within 2 minutes of receipt with zero manual intervention
• Extract and score 50+ viral social media opportunities weekly from processed transcripts
• Build queryable knowledge base from 700+ existing transcripts and 3,900+ Notion records
• Enable natural language queries across entire sales history to identify winning patterns
• Improve close rate by 10%+ within 60 days through data-driven insights and pattern analysis
• Establish foundation for scaling from 2 to 7+ specialized CrewAI agents as value is proven

### Background Context
Stellar Connect addresses the critical inefficiency in trust and estate planning sales operations where advisors spend 40% of their time on administrative tasks instead of selling. With 700+ unprocessed transcripts containing valuable sales intelligence and 3,900+ Notion records that cannot be effectively queried, the current workflow creates a compound opportunity cost - missing revenue-generating patterns, viral content opportunities, and delayed client engagement. The platform leverages local LLMs (Mistral-7B with MLX optimization), PostgreSQL for structured data, and CrewAI agent orchestration to create a privacy-first intelligence system that runs entirely on the M2 Max MacBook, ensuring complete data security for sensitive estate planning information.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A command-center interface optimized for rapid information access and minimal interaction overhead. The design prioritizes keyboard navigation, dense information display, and one-click actions to support high-velocity sales workflows. The interface should feel like a professional trading terminal - powerful, efficient, and focused on actionable intelligence rather than aesthetic flourishes.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
• **Chat-First Intelligence:** Natural language query bar as primary interaction method for finding patterns, prospects, and insights
• **Auto-Process Pipeline:** Zero-click transcript processing with visual status indicators showing real-time progress
• **Quick Actions:** Single-click email copy, content export, and disposition setting from any view
• **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Power-user shortcuts for common actions (e.g., Cmd+E for email, Cmd+D for disposition)
• **Inline Editing:** Direct field editing in table views without modal dialogs or separate forms
• **Smart Notifications:** Toast notifications for completed processing with direct links to results

### Core Screens and Views
• **Dashboard/Command Center:** Real-time processing status, today's meetings, disposition summary, viral content queue
• **Transcript Processor View:** Live feed of incoming transcripts with processing stages and extracted data preview
• **Sales Pipeline View:** Kanban-style board showing prospects by disposition (Follow Up, Closed Won, Closed Lost)
• **Intelligence Query Interface:** Gradio chat interface with saved queries, results export, and pattern visualization
• **Prospect Detail View:** Complete prospect profile with all transcripts, emails, notes, and deal information
• **Content Library:** Scored social media content with platform filters, copy buttons, and performance tracking
• **Email Station:** Generated emails with edit capability, send history, and template management
• **Settings/Configuration:** Agent configuration, folder paths, processing rules, and backup management

### Accessibility: None
Initial MVP will not require WCAG compliance, but interface will use semantic HTML and proper contrast ratios to facilitate future accessibility upgrades.

### Branding
Minimal, professional aesthetic focused on data density and clarity. Dark mode by default to reduce eye strain during extended use. Color coding for dispositions (green for won, yellow for follow-up, red for lost). No corporate branding requirements for MVP.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only
Optimized for macOS desktop browsers (Safari, Chrome) on high-resolution displays. Responsive design not required for MVP as this is a single-user desktop application. Minimum resolution 1920x1080, optimized for 2560x1440 or higher.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all services, agents, database schemas, and UI components. This simplifies dependency management, enables atomic commits across the stack, and aligns with single-developer maintenance. Structure will follow: `/agents`, `/api`, `/ui`, `/database`, `/models`, `/utils`.

### Service Architecture
**Modular Monolith with Agent Orchestration:** Core Python application with CrewAI agent framework, running as separate processes that communicate via PostgreSQL and message queues. Services include: transcript watcher (filesystem monitor), processing pipeline (CrewAI orchestrator), database service (PostgreSQL interface), RAG service (Qdrant + MLX), and web interface (Gradio). Each service can run independently for testing but orchestrated together in production.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Focus:** Unit tests for all data extraction and transformation logic, integration tests for agent communication and database operations, end-to-end tests for critical paths (transcript processing, email generation). Manual testing convenience methods for LLM prompt validation and email template preview. No extensive UI testing in MVP given Gradio's built-in components.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
• **Language & Framework:** Python 3.11+ for all backend services, leveraging async/await for concurrent operations
• **LLM Infrastructure:** Mistral-7B-Instruct via MLX framework for Apple Silicon optimization, with 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
• **Agent Framework:** CrewAI 0.1.x for agent orchestration, starting with 2 agents, architected to scale to 7+
• **Database Stack:** PostgreSQL 15+ as primary datastore, Qdrant for vector embeddings, SQLite for agent state persistence
• **Frontend:** Gradio 4.x for chat interface and basic UI, with custom CSS for professional styling
• **File Monitoring:** Python watchdog library for Google Drive folder monitoring with debouncing for file sync delays
• **Data Processing:** Pandas for Notion CSV parsing and data transformation, SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
• **Deployment:** Local-only via Python virtual environment, with systemd service files for auto-start on boot
• **Development Tools:** Poetry for dependency management, Black for code formatting, pytest for testing framework
• **Memory Management:** Batch processing with configurable chunk sizes, lazy loading for large datasets, explicit garbage collection after transcript processing
• **Error Handling:** Structured logging with Python logging module, failed transcript quarantine folder, automatic retry with exponential backoff
• **Security:** All data remains local, no external API calls except for MLX model initial download, database encryption at rest via transparent disk encryption

**Appropriately Scoped:** The 5-epic structure delivers incremental value starting with immediate ROI (email automation) while building toward sophisticated intelligence capabilities. Epic sizing allows for focused 2-week sprints with measurable outcomes.

**Strong Foundation:** Epic 1 properly establishes infrastructure and data migration, ensuring all subsequent epics build on solid foundations.

**Value-Driven Progression:** Each epic delivers standalone value while preparing for the next, avoiding the "big bang" approach that often fails in MVP development.

### Technical Readiness
**Clear Constraints:** Local-only processing, M2 Max optimization, and 32GB memory limits are well-defined and consistently applied.

**Proven Technology Stack:** CrewAI, MLX, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant represent a mature, tested combination for this use case.

**Risk Mitigation:** Technical assumptions include fallback mechanisms and performance validation criteria.

### Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- MLX quantization settings optimization may require architect experimentation
- Gradio UI capabilities vs custom React implementation trade-off needs validation

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Vector embedding model fine-tuning for trust/estate terminology
- Optimal transcript chunking strategy (1000 vs 500 tokens)

**LOW Priority:**
- Future Neo4j integration planning
- Multi-user expansion considerations

### Recommendations

**READY FOR ARCHITECT:** This PRD provides comprehensive guidance for architectural design with clear constraints, well-structured epics, and realistic technical assumptions.

**Next Steps:**
1. Architect should validate MLX performance assumptions with proof-of-concept
2. UI framework decision (Gradio vs custom) should be prototyped early
3. Database schema design should begin with Epic 1 Story 1.2
