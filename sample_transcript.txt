SALES MEETING TRANSCRIPT
Date: December 15, 2024
Client: Sarah Mitchell, CEO of Mitchell Enterprises
Sales Representative: John Davis

John: Good morning Sarah, thank you for taking the time to meet with us today to discuss your estate planning needs.

Sarah: Thank you for coming, John. As I mentioned on the phone, with our company's recent expansion and my personal assets growing to around $15 million, I really need to get my estate planning in order.

John: Absolutely, and that's exactly what we specialize in at Stellar Connect. We provide comprehensive estate planning solutions that protect your assets and ensure smooth wealth transfer. Can you tell me more about your current situation and concerns?

Sarah: Well, Mitchell Enterprises has been incredibly successful this year. We've expanded into three new markets, and I have significant personal investments in real estate and the stock market. My main concern is ensuring my two children are taken care of, but I also want to minimize the tax burden on the estate.

John: Those are excellent priorities. Our trust structuring services can help significantly reduce estate taxes while ensuring your children receive their inheritance according to your wishes. We typically see tax savings of 30-40% with proper planning.

Sarah: That sounds impressive. How does your process work exactly?

John: We start with a comprehensive asset review, then our team of estate attorneys and tax specialists design a customized plan. This usually includes setting up trusts, reviewing beneficiary designations, and creating tax-efficient transfer strategies. The entire process typically takes 6-8 weeks.

Sarah: I appreciate the thoroughness. What about ongoing management? Things change, and I want to ensure the plan stays current.

John: Great question. We provide annual reviews and updates as part of our premium service package. Any major life events or tax law changes trigger an automatic review. Our clients really value this proactive approach.

Sarah: This is exactly what I've been looking for. The peace of mind alone is worth it. What are the next steps?

John: I'm glad to hear that! The next step would be scheduling an initial consultation with our estate planning team. They'll need to review your financial documents and discuss your specific goals in detail. I can arrange that for next week if you're available.

Sarah: Yes, let's do that. Tuesday or Wednesday works best for me.

John: Perfect. I'll have our team reach out to confirm Tuesday afternoon. We'll also send over our initial questionnaire and document checklist so you can prepare.

Sarah: Wonderful. You know, John, I've spoken with several firms, but your approach feels the most comprehensive and personalized. I'm looking forward to moving forward with Stellar Connect.

John: Thank you, Sarah. We're excited to help you protect and preserve your wealth for future generations.
