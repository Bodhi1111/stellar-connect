1460,2024/01/18,Wayne Porter,Follow up,60,Partner/Spouse,A lot of moving parts,0,0,"1/18/24 - Wayne and his wife already have a Revocable Living Trust from 2007 that they updated in 2017. They are concerned about the estate planning threshold in 2026 which depends on what we call the ""sunset"" provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. These provisions temporarily increased the federal estate and gift tax exemption amounts. Current situation: As of 2023, the individual estate tax exemption is $12.92 million and the married couple exemption is double that, at $25.84 million. Potential change in 2026: Unless Congress acts by the end of 2025 to make the TCJA provisions permanent, the exemption amounts will revert to their pre-TCJA levels, adjusted for inflation. This means the individual exemption could drop to around $7 million and the married couple exemption to around $14 million. This will affect the Porters, who, after their gift giving and establishing multiple Trusts; SLATs, Porter Trusts, Family Trusts, and Charitable Gift Trusts still have a current estate valued a little over ~$10M. I sold Wayne on our availability to offer support, our one-stop shop for all of the resources we offer under one roof. He liked that we offer an online portal and can assist his family with communicating what his beneficiaries need for Trust delivery. Major drawback is having to re-title his numerous accounts and assets into a new RLT. That being said, Wayne said he'll still review with his wife. Set a task to follow up with him. "

They have an outdated Will. They have two daughters age 60 yo, and 62 yo. They expressed resistance to buy the Trust saying they needed to talk to their daughters first (and the county judge?), but I asked them what they needed to discuss. They said they have the oldest daughter as their current outdated Will's Executor. Point is, I almost didn't get them onboard due to this smokescreen objection. I told them that they can name whomever they want as the Successor Trustee, and they can change it later, if they so wish or desire. I asked Louy (the more hesitant of the two) what was his reservation. He told me about a few bad experiences with Trusts. I readdressed our credibility (showcasing reviews, mentioning there is no way we'd have an A+ rating with the BBB if we didn't do great work. Mentioned how our Trusts have never been challenged in court and we have a money back guarantee. Battled. (120 min. call).

I isolated the objection, and I got to it being too expensive for her. Ultimately, I don't accept this. How could I have countered this? Built more value. Not just tell her what we save her, but really get her to buy-in to what I'm saying. I battled on this call for 115 min. - almost 2 hours. I did it because it is the only meeting I have on my calendar, and I wanted to flex on some of my objection handeling skills. She was willing to stay on the call with me. She didn't hang up on me. So I saw the opportunity to practice objection handeling. Even though this meeting didn't close. It was a good call. "
